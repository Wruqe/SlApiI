## Description

"slAPI", a pun of slappy, is a web application that serves as a repository for all things silly and whimsical. Users can explore a collection of funny and quirky data, as well as contribute their own by adding new silly entries.

Along with these contributions, users can rate other's posts. These ratings calculate our an average score, showing all users what their average rating on the platform is.

While there, users can interact with one another in the chat-box, allowing for me tomfoolery and ballyhoo to take place in real time.
